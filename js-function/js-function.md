JavaScript Functions
====================


Upfront, I've never really delved very much into js functions beyond the basics.
Generally I use functions as things that return something based on some parameters, which is pretty much the stock mathematical idea of a function.

But in js function are also objects, and you can attach properties in various ways - want to explore a little.
