The term 'promise'
------------------

Upfront, I dislike the term 'promise'.

It's a peculiarly human-values centric idea, whereas most of the analogies/metaphors we use in computing are from more prosaic sources such as science, engineering, and everyday objects.

I wish it had been called something like 'contract' instead.
