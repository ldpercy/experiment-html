HTML App
========


Going to try to combine a few common page setup features into a small class.

For event registration I think it'll need to be split it into two phases
1. Register initial DOMContentLoaded event at load/instantitaion time
2. Register all remaining events when that one fires

I'm simultaneously using/developing this in a couple of other places so will collect together what's current here.
