Inner/Outer HTML
----------------

One thing I'm curious about, but suspect probably can't be done, is whether it's possible to access the generated html.

For example in the yearclock I'm currently using template strings for *everything*, which means that a complete svg document gets produced that can stand alone.
I use this to save the output for static readme examples for instance.
With web components the custom elements wouldn't have very much meaning in a nonscripted environment, so I would no longer be able to do that afaik.

Something to look into.
