Testing
=======


This **really** isn't the sort of thing I should be attempting, but there's basically nothing built into core js or the apis that I can see save for the lonely `console.assert()` function.

So I'm going to whip together a little module to help with some things.

A single test will be:

* one or more values/expressions
* a predicate to be said about those values/expressions, eg allEqual

eg
	[1,2]
