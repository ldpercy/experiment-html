	<h2>How do inline styles apply to content?</h2>

	<p>
		A paragraph, no styles yet.
		I'll put a 'style' tag after it to change the colour.
	</p>

	<style>
		p {color:red; }
	</style>
	<p>
		Another paragraph; there's a 'style' tag just above this time, between this and the previous p tag.
		The 'p' style applies to both paragraphs.
	</p>

	<style>
		p {font-family:monospace;}
	</style>
	<p>
		And again, this time to monospace.
	</p>

	<style>
		p {color:green;}
	</style>
	<p>
		And finally override to green.
	</p>

	<p>
		Rightyo then.
		There isn't anything like 'styles apply until until overridden', it doesn't work that way.
		The inline styles probably get combined into a single stylesheet, with it's own override cascade, then applied to the document as a whole.
		Makes sense, but haven't tried anything this basic in a <i>very</i> long time.
