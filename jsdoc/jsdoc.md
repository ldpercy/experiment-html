JSDoc
=====

VSCode
------
I'm running this straight in VSCode with no other tooling, so I presume whatever is working is built-in somewhat.
Should try to find out what and how...

But for now, JSDoc is being parsed and I can apply and check types.



Type resolution
---------------

Until I can find more info, one thing I curious about is how types are resolved - do they have namespaces, belong to modules etc.

From some quick tests right now it seems like it's aware of types in the same folder, and worked when I pushed the type to a subfolder.
Over in yearclock though, didn't find the subfolder type.
Have to figure out what it's doing.
