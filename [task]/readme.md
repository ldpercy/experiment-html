Meta
----
So far most of the experiments in here have been pretty small and self-contained, and I've left markdown docs around the place to summarise findings.
And sometimes while figuring things out I've also added brief-ish trains of thought.
Some experiments are starting to get more involved though and will need better tracking, so setting this folder up like I've done in other projects.

Won't do branch-merge-release here though - this project will stay all trunk development - so 'done' tasks will probably end up grouped by date.
When html-common gets into release cadence some tasks will be moved over to there.



Todo
----
* "Layout was forced before the page was fully loaded. If stylesheets are not yet loaded this may cause a flash of unstyled content."
* "This expression is not constructable. Type '....' has no construct signatures.ts(2351)"
* Derived subclass as function parameter?
* JSDoc partial typing - see if there are ways to declare generic types that only specify certain items of a type signature, eg *just* the return type of a function - and be able to mix these partials together a bit like interfaces
* See if there's a way to type the whole of a function's arguments object, not just individual parameters
* See if @interface typing can be applied to non-class objects
* Look for other duck/mixin typing options
* Find out where the root/base context of jsconfig+checkJs typechecking is
* See if there's a way to turn on jsdoc typechecking for inline `<script></script>` within html - nothing found so far
* CSS colour model/api etc
* dynamic/automatic/contextual colours for text
* Parent selector - 'has'
* See if there's a way to collapse the single extra spaces that sometimes get added just from formatting, eg `<h1>	<a ...`
* Grid layout - see if there's an simpler way of making grid items go full-width
* 3d transform experiments



### Done
* Testing - simple code testing eg equality, exceptions, typeof testing that code excepts - moved to `html-common`
* Function arguments can be omitted to accept defaults with `undefined`
* CSS `grey` is darker than `darkgrey` for historical reasons - websearch for the whole story



Experimental/tentative patterns
-------------------------------

### Custom setters that return `this` for chaining

	setCoord(x,y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; return this; }

> A 'set' accessor must have exactly one parameter.ts(1049)
> Setters cannot return a value.ts(2408)

Stock js setters can only have one param, and cannot return anything so they can't be chained.

In some places I'm writing custom setters that accept more parameters, and return `this` to allow for chaining.
I'm not sure if i want to go boots-and-all with this yet, but trying it out in a few spots; makes some testing code a bit easier for example.
